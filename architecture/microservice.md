## Architecture
- Has its public interfaces
- Has its own database
- One microservice can have multiple processes
## Design
- Identify Microservices  
  - Domain Driven Design
    Identify Business Domain/Bounded Context/Data Model
  - Business Capability/Function  
  - Business Organization
  - Change Frequency
  - (Monolith) Database seams
  - (Monolith) Loose-couple modules: if a change to a miroservice will cause changes to other services, then we should think about is it part of other service.
  - (Monolith) Common Functions
  - (Monolith) New features as microservice
- Granularity
  DDD and bounded context as first step.  
  - Too coarse-grained  
    - Too many responsibilities, everything goes to this microservice.  
    - Manages data across a large number of tables
      Use the guideline that a microservice should own no more than three to five tables.  
    - Too many test cases  
      e.g. hundreds of unit and integration tests
  - Too fine-grained
    - Become a collection of simple CRUD
    - Heavily interdependent on one another (Chatty Services), one user operation requires too many services call.    
## Communication
- Synchronous (RESTFul API)
- ASynchronous
  - Messaging (RabitMQ/Kafka)
  - ASychrounous call + Webhook callback
- Resillency
  - Retry with backoff
  - Circuit Breaker
  - Caching
  - Message Retries (Message Handler must be idempotent)
## Build
- Service Template, including authentication, logging etc.
- Automated Test: Unit Test, Service Test, End-to-end test
## Security
- Encryption at transit(TLS), Encryption at rest
- Authentication (Oauth2/OIDC), Authorization
- To avoid Confused Dupety
- Virtual Network, IP Whitelisting, Firewall, API Gateway
## Deployment
- Blue-green deployment
- Rolling Upgrade (Kubernetes)
## Monitoring
- Host (CPU/Memory/Alert)
- Application (Health check/HTTP Request Errors/Queue Length)
- Log (Aggregated, standardized)

## Concept
My understanding: Microservice is to address non-functional requirements and techincal needs in three areas:-  
- **Maintenability**: Fast change and evolve part of the system  
- **Scalability**  
- **Performance**: Use appropriate technology Stack  

Benifit:  
- Own CICD lifecycle, fast to evolve
- Fault isolation
- Increase throughput

## Difficulties
- Code will increase 35-45 percent compare to monolithic
- Distributed Transaction (SAGA pattern to solve)  
  -> Doesn't support Read isolation (use process orchestrator to solve)

## Migration
- How to start
  - Start with new function/features.
  - Start with functions required scale up on demand.
  - Start with frequently changed functions, from the least coupled functionalities.
  - Prefered to choose functionanlity with user interface.
- Strangler Pattern  
  https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html  
  https://martinfowler.com/bliki/EventInterception.html  
  - Analyze system modules.
  - Design a logical breakdown of the modules into probable services.
  - Identify the first batch of modules with the least dependencies to be moved out.
  - Rewrite these modules as microservices and, then, let microservices shadow the modules for some time.
  - Once the microservices are stabilized, strangulate/disconnect the original modules.
  - Repeat this process for other modules  
- Design consideration
  - Determine how micro the microservice to be, make sure Ops team can handle like monitoring.
  - Decide how many microservice should be called in a sequence.
- Setup DevOps pipeline for the first microservice
- Database Decomposition
  - Database wrapping service‚Äù pattern.

## Practice
- Make sure the infrastructure is ready before making any commitment to the migration (It will take 2-3 month). Infrastructure includes:-  
	- API gateways
  - SSO
  - Service mesh
  - Event-driven architecture
  - DevSecOps pipelines
  - Developer tools and utilities
  - Agile project management
  - Issue tracking solutions
  - Logging
  - Monitoring solutions and so on.

## Microservice Concern  
**Design**
- Data model sharing  
  Event sourcing and CQRS: one service emits event, other service use the event to build it's own model.  
  DON'T overuse it, to be use when necessary.
- Distributed Transaction  
  Eventual Consistent:  
  Saga: compensation transaction callback is invoked when need to rollback.

**Operation**
- Security/Authentication  
  API Gateway.  
  Approach 1: Kong Ingress Controller with OIDC plugin, no authentication at springboot.  
- Deployment  
  Docker.
- Service discovery
- Request routing
- Service failure handling
- Logging

## Patterns
- API Gateway
- Back For Frontend (BFF)
- Saga
- Event Sourcing
