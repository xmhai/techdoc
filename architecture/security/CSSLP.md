## Encryption
- Algorithm
  - Use approved cryptographic libraries which are overt implementation.
- Key
  - Protect the key.

## CIA Implementation
- Confidential (protecting the data from unauthorized access)
  - Access Control (data in use, data at rest)
  - Encryption (data in transit, data at rest)
- Integrity (protecting the data from unauthorized alteration)
  - Access Control
  - Determining whether the information has been altered or not
- Availability
  - Denying illegitimate access
  - Preventing availability attacks

## Authentication
- What user know (password)
- What user have (token, key, mobile phone)
- What user are (fingerprint, iris)
- What user do (typing pattern)
- Where user is (ip, location)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
