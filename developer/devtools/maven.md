## Concept  
A build framework using plugins to manage build processes: Compiling, Testing, Reporting, Packaging  
- Standard project directory layout (Archetypes, can build own and use as local)  
- Manage dependency  
  Handle transitive dependency  
- lifecycle, build phases, goals
- plugins  
e.g. mvn dependency:tree is using plugin  
- pom.xml  

## Configuration
- pom.xml  
  pom.xml is inherited from maven super pom, parent pom. e.g. "central" repository is defined in super pom  
  - repository  
    define repository with an **id**, this id will be referred in settings.xml.  
- settings.xml  
  - proxy (enterprise environment)   
  - can encrypt password  
  - mirrors (enterprise environment)  
    for maven to use enterprise repository by having it mirror all repositry request, this overrides what is in pom.xml
  - servers  
    the id of the server need to match the id of repository defined in pom.xml.  

## Dependency
- How maven decide the version of dependency:   
  - Closest to the tree  
    so that we can include specific JAR version in pom, this will override the implicit dependency.  
  - First-found dependency  
- To view dependency tree:  
  mvn dependency:tree  
- To resolve JAR conflict
  - Either use \<exclusion> tag  
  - Or include specific version in pom.    

## Properties
- Implicit Properties which can be referred directly in pom  
  project.xxx, env.xxx, settings.xxx  
- User-Defined Properties  
  defined under \<properties>

## Lifecycle
- Goal
  - Maven goals are granular and typically perform one task  
  - Goals in Maven are packaged in plugins  
    e.g. run "mvn complier:compile", **compiler** is the **plugin** that provides the **goal compile**
- Plugin  
  https://www.baeldung.com/core-maven-plugins  
  - JAR file that can performs some tasks (goals)  
  - Use @Mojo to define custom plugin goal and default phase (either use @Mojo(defaultPhase=...) annotaion or @goal and @phase in Javadoc)  
  - Two types: Build plugin and reporting plugin  
  - Build plugin can have a default phase
- Lifecycle
  Mavenâ€™s build lifecycle constitutes a series of stages (phases) that get executed in the same order. (https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference)  
  Maven project has the following three built-in lifecycles:  
  - default  
    responsible for all steps in the build process.
  - clean
  - site  
    in charge of building a site, showing Maven related information of the project.  
- Phase
  - The \<packaging> element in the pom.xml file will automatically assign the right goals for each of the phases.  
  - Each phase is associated with zero or more goals.  
  - For phases without any goals associated, Maven will skip the phase execution. Such phases serve as placeholders for users and third-party vendors to associate their custom-built goals.
  - Maven automatically executes all the phases prior to a requested phase.

## mvn commandline  
- mvn -v  

Execute a goal  
- mvn **[plugin_identifier]:[goal_identifier]**  
- mvn dependency:tree
- mvn complier:compile
- mvn help:describe -Dplugin=compiler

Execute one or more phases  
- mvn **[phase] [phase]**  
- mvn package

## Maven plugins
Maven default plugins are developed as Maven project (e.g. maven-surefire-plugin, maven-jar-plugin...)
- help (built-in)
- compiler
- clean
- ...

## Multiple Module
- parent POM  
  \<packaging>pom\<\packaging>  
  \<modules>\<module>...\<\modules>  
  **Using the dependencyManagement tag in the parent POM file**  
  \<dependencyManagement>  
  **good practice to explicitly declare the configuration and lockdown the versions for any plugins required in a multi-module project**
  \<pluginManagement>  
  If project parent pom (i.e. used by one project), then put it at project root,  
  else if standard parent pom (e.g. like spring-boot-parent), then create it separately.  
- child POM  
  \<parent>  
    use empty relativePath \<relativePath/> when using standard pom like spring-boot-parent.  
    use \<relativePath>../pom.xml</relativePath> for project parent pom.  
  **using the dependencies in the child's POM files (sub-modules) and even the parent module itself (if applicable)**
  \<dependencies>
  \<plugins>

## Question
- Which lifecycle is invoked?  
  Decided by the phases passed in mvn command.  
- Where are the phase defined for a lifecycle?  
  https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference  
- Is the phase name unique?  
  yes
- Where the the phase goals are defined?  
  When create plugin, we can specify the default phase or goal (refer to above plugin section),  
  also we can specify extra plugin, goals and phase in \<build> section.  
  Can customize own maven phase:  
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12433120/creating-a-new-phase  
- How does the short form plugin name like to plugin jar file? e.g. mvn jetty:run  
  This is done automatically if you follow the convention of using ${prefix}-maven-plugin (or maven-${prefix}-plugin if the plugin is part of the Apache Maven project)  
  https://maven.apache.org/guides/plugin/guide-java-plugin-development.html  
- To execute JUnit test only  
  mvn -Dtest=NameOfTest surefire:test
