## Deployment
- Recommend running Kibana separate from your Elasticsearch data or master nodes.
- Depends on your use case, in most cases, one node should be sufficient, multiple Kibana instances for large number of heavy Kibana users.
- Kibana isnâ€™t terribly resource intensive, it has a default maximum memory limit of 1.4 GB, and in most cases, we recommend leaving this unconfigured.

## Installation
- Standalone  
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/rpm.html  
Note:  
  - Kibana version must be **exactly** same version as ElasticSearch (curl http://localhost:9200 to get ES-version).  
  Follow the steps in "Download and install the RPM manually":  
    ```sh
    wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-<ES-version>-x86_64.rpm
    sudo rpm --install kibana-<ES-version>-x86_64.rpm
    ```
  - Configure
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml  
    # Set server.host to server IP or "0.0.0.0"
    ```
  - Follow the steps to start the service
- Docker
