## Concept  
Managing build processes: Compiling, Testing, Reporting, Packaging  
- Standard project directory layout (Archetypes, can build own and use as local)  
- Manage dependency  
  Handle transitive dependency  
- lifecycle, build phases, goals
- plugins  
e.g. mvn dependency:tree is using plugin  
- pom.xml  

## Configuration
- settings.xml  
  - (enterprise users) configure proxy  
  - (enterprise users) configure repository  
  - can encrypt password  

## Dependency
- dependency mediation  
  - closest to the tree  
  - first-found dependency  
  - can override by explicitly include the JAR in pom  
  - mvn dependency:tree  
  - to resolve JAR conflict, can use \<exclusion> tag  

## Properties
- Implicit Properties  
  project.xxx, env.xxx, settings.xxx  
- User-Defined Properties  
  defined under \<properties>

## Lifecycle
- Goal
  - Maven goals are granular and typically perform one task  
  - Goals in Maven are packaged in plugins  
    e.g. run "mvn complier:compile", **compiler** is the **plugin** that provides the **goal compile**
- plugin
  - JAR file that can performs some tasks (goals)  
  - Use @Mojo to define custom plugin goal and default phase (either use @Mojo(defaultPhase=...) annotaion or @goal and @phase in Javadoc)  
  - Two types: Build plugin and reporting plugin  
  - Build plugin can have a default phase
- Lifecycle
  Mavenâ€™s build lifecycle constitutes a series of stages (phases) that get executed in the same order. (https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference)  
  Maven project has the following three built-in lifecycles:  
  - default: validate, resources (resources), compile (compiler), test (test), package (war), verify, install (install), deploy (deploy)
  - clean
  - site  
- Phase
  - The \<packaging> element in the pom.xml file will automatically assign the right goals for each of the phases.  
  - Each phase is associated with zero or more goals.  
  - For phases without any goals associated, Maven will skip the phase execution. Such phases serve as placeholders for users and third-party vendors to associate their custom-built goals.
  - Maven automatically executes all the phases prior to a requested phase.

## mvn commandline  
- mvn -v  

Execute a goal  
- mvn **[plugin_identifier]:[goal_identifier]**  
- mvn dependency:tree
- mvn complier:compile
- mvn help:describe -Dplugin=compiler

Execute one or more phases  
- mvn package

## Maven plugins
Maven default plugins are developed as Maven project (e.g. maven-surefire-plugin, maven-jar-plugin...)
- help (built-in)
- compiler
- clean
- ...

## Multiple Module
- parent POM  
  \<packaging>pom\<\packaging>  
  \<modules>\<module>...\<\modules>  
- \<pluginmanagement>  
  affect this POM and all inheriting POMs. 
- \<pluginmanagement>

## Question
- Which lifecycle is invoked?
  Decided by the phases passed in mvn command.  
- Where are the phase defined for a lifecycle?  
  https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference  
- Is the phase name unique?
  yes
- Where the the phase goals are defined?  
  There are default plugin could be defined in plugin, also we can specify extra plugin, goals and phase in \<build> section.  
  Can customize own maven phase:  
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12433120/creating-a-new-phase  
- How does the short form plugin name like to plugin jar file? e.g. mvn jetty:run  
  This is done automatically if you follow the convention of using ${prefix}-maven-plugin (or maven-${prefix}-plugin if the plugin is part of the Apache Maven project)  
  https://maven.apache.org/guides/plugin/guide-java-plugin-development.html  
- To execute JUnit test only  
  mvn -Dtest=NameOfTest surefire:test
